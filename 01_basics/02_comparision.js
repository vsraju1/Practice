// these are just normal comparisions 
// console.log(2 > 1)
// console.log(2 < 1)
// console.log(2 <= 1)
// console.log(2 >= 1)
// console.log(2 == 1)
// console.log(2 != 1)

// The following are some tricky comparisions 

console.log("2" > 1) //auto matically string 2 converted into number (expected answer would be true cuz 2 > 1)
console.log("1" == 1) //expected anwer is true

console.log("1" === 1) //comparing two types including datatype(===) => expected answer is false
